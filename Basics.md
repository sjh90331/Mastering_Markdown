# Basics of Markdown

## Headers
Headers are used to create titles and subtitles. You can create a header by using the `#` symbol followed by a space and the header text. The number of `#` symbols indicates the header level. For example, `# Header 1`, `## Header 2`, `### Header 3`.

## Emphasis
You can emphasize text by making it bold or italic. Use `*` or `_` for italics (e.g., `*italic*` or `_italic_`) and `**` or `__` for bold (e.g., `**bold**` or `__bold__`). You can also combine them to create bold and italic text (e.g., `**_bold and italic_**`).

## Lists
You can create unordered lists using `*`, `-`, or `+` and ordered lists using numbers followed by a period. For example:

Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
or

Item 1
Item 2
Item 3

## Links
You can create links using the format `link text`. For example, `GitHub` will create a link to GitHub.

## Images
Images are similar to links but they include a `!` at the beginning. The format is `!alt text`. The alt text will be displayed if the image cannot be loaded.

## Code and Syntax Highlighting
You can create inline code by wrapping the text in backticks (\`). For example, \`code\`. You can create code blocks by wrapping the text in triple backticks (```). If you specify a language after the opening backticks, it will also provide syntax highlighting.

## Blockquotes
You can create blockquotes using the `>` symbol. For example, `> This is a blockquote.`
